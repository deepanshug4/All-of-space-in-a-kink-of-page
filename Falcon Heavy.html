<h2>Falcon Heavy</h2>


Its first test flight took place on February 6th, 2018, with the successful launch of a Tesla Roadster into outer space and the landing and recovery of its two Falcon boosters back on earth. It sits at 229.6 feet tall and maintains a liftoff thrust of 5 million pounds. It has the capability of taking 140,660 pounds into LEO at a cost of $90 million USD, practically breaking down all previous barriers to entry for space flight.

While the launch was historic, NASA has a rocket system coming for SpaceXâ€™s privately funded endeavors, called the Space Launch System or SLS.
