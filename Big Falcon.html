<h2>Big Falcon</h2>
<br>

SpaceX is also developing an even bigger rocket system called the Big Falcon Rocket. It will have a height of 348 feet, a payload capacity of 330,000 pounds, and a thrust of 11.8 million pounds. The BFR would rival NASAâ€™s SLS for its top spot and could potentially come in at a much cheaper price.<br>
