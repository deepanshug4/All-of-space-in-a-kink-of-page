<h2>Saturn V</h2>

The Saturn V remains the tallest and most powerful rocket system ever and the only one to have helped carry humans beyond Earth’s orbit. NASA used the platform in the Apollo 11 through 17 missions.

The rocket comes in at a staggering 363 feet tall with a liftoff thrust of 7.6 million pounds. It had the capability of taking 260,000 pounds of into low earth orbit (LEO) but after it’s last mission in 1973, the rocket system was officially retired by NASA. While the Saturn V may still have the top spot in history, the Falcon Heavy holds the spot for the most powerful rocket in existence.
