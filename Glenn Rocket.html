<h2>Glenn Rocket</h2>

<br>
Blue Origin is the space startup created by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. They currently have a small reusable rocket in operation to send humans on sub-orbital tourist trips, but they plan on building a new bigger rocket capable of sending cargo to LEO.<br>

<br>
The scheduled test flight for the New Glenn Rocket is set for no earlier than 2020. It comes in at a height of 326 feet with a liftoff thrust of 3.9 million pounds. With an estimated cargo capacity of 100,000 pounds, this rocket wonâ€™t set any records, but it will offer up even greater competition in getting cargo and humans to space.

These 4 rockets are the past and soon to be future leaders in heavy lift technology for space flight, but there are a few other notable rockets that should be mentioned.</div>
